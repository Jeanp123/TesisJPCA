	abstractNote={<jats:p>In today’s world, 918 million rural people are more easily connected to the internet than doctors. The rural part of India is still in crisis due to lack of doctors and gets only one-third of hospital facilities. 80\% doctors are available only in urban areas. In this paper, an application is developed with a motive of connecting doctors and assisting medication primarily focusing on rural and urban areas. The main idea is to create a user-friendly virtual assistant which helps every citizen, mainly residing in the rural parts of India. There are few industrial bots for News, Weather, Trends and perhaps different day-after-day events that manifest themselves within the general class. The proposed application takes a prominent place in the medical field. The bot recommends the best medical practice to the patients in treating minor medical issues. In the future, this Medical Chatbot can be trained with doctors to treat some minor surgeries.</jats:p>},
